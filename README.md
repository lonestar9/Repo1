#StackGen - A python package that performs stacked generalization

#Requirements
Python 3
NumPy
scikit-learn
unittest (for the testing module)


#Code
The entire code is in the "Stacked_Generalization" directory


#Run
In a terminal, navigate to the top level of the directory and launch jupyter notebook server to view the notebooks with examples. If you want to use StackGen for your own models, copy the "Stacked_Generalization" folder to your current directory and import StackGen as follows
>>> from Stacked_Generalization.StackGen import StackGen
>>> stacked_regressor = StackGen(..)


#Examples
While running the Jupyter notebooks with classification examples, ensure that the notebook and that dataset "CTG - required cols with NSP.csv" are in the same directory. 


## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## License
