#StackGen - A python package that performs stacked generalization

#Requirements
Python 3
NumPy
scikit-learn
unittest (for the testing module)


#Code
The entire code is in the "Stacked_Generalization" directory


#Run
In a terminal, navigate to the top level of the directory and launch jupyter notebook server to view the notebooks with examples. If you want to use StackGen for your own models, copy the "Stacked_Generalization" folder to your current directory and import StackGen as follows
>>> from Stacked_Generalization.StackGen import StackGen
>>> stacked_regressor = StackGen(..)


#Examples
While running the Jupyter notebooks with classification examples, ensure that the notebook and that dataset "CTG - required cols with NSP.csv" are in the same directory.
